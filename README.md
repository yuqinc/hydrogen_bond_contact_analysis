# hydrogen_bond_contact_analysis

This repository is about analysis interaction between DNA and histone amino acid chains in the vacinity of DNA damage site in the context of a nucleosome core particle. 

The data is obtained via cpptraj of the AMBER 14 package. 
I grouped and sorted the data and obtain a small dataframe. 

Then I use stacked bar plot and heatmap to visualize the results.
